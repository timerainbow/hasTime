1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:09,425
In 2291, Slipspace technology
makes space colonization a reality.

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:13,679
In 30 years,
mankind establishes the Inner Colonies...

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,556
...in the heart of the Milky Way...

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,893
...and soon into the outer periphery.

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:27,234
In the year 2525, the human race
encounters an advanced alien alliance.

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:32,072
This alliance called itself the Covenant.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,702
The Covenant decrees humanity
an affront to their gods...

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,914
...and the Human-Covenant War begins.

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,045
Within a decade, the Outer Colonies
are almost completely annihilated...

10
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,255
...by the power of the Covenant.

11
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:53,552
In the face of direct attacks on the
Inner Colonies by Covenant forces...

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,221
...humanity's only remaining hope...

13
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:01,643
...depends on a special unit
of genetically-augmented soldiers.

14
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:06,940
These soldiers were known
as the Spartan-lls.

15
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,954
They finally decide to give the order
to pull out and now this.

16
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,040
Damn it. It just ain't my day.

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,211
Mac, watch out!

18
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,258
Here they come.

19
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,239
Oh, damn it. This just ain't my day.

20
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,753
What the hell?

21
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,188
Maybe this is my day.

22
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,151
All right, men. Let's welcome
our chief petty officer with some backup.

23
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,050
And stay down.

24
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,062
How's Gamma-4?

25
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,897
Gamma-4 is gone.

26
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,400
Then that means this planet is finished.

27
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,861
And it won't be the last, sir.

28
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,405
I have the main unit on the line.

29
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,741
Rescue team will be in accordance...

30
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,078
...with the order to fully disengage.
Dispatching a rescue craft.

31
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,247
All active units respond immediately.

32
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,711
Team Gamma here, roger that.
We are completely surrounded.

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,921
Copy that, marine.

34
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,340
We're dispatching a rescue ship
to your location.

35
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,218
But I'm afraid we can't
exactly give you curbside service.

36
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,097
Sending coordinates for extraction point.
You're going to have to make your way...

37
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,848
- Wait a sec.
- What?

38
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,227
I know that voice. Is that you?

39
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,730
Daisy. That's you, isn't it?

40
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,652
Ralph.

41
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,951
Where do we go now?
I don't know.

42
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,036
- Anywhere but that place.
Yeah.

43
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,748
I don't wanna think about
what they'd do to us if we did go back.

44
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,210
We're not gonna be your toys anymore.

45
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,963
She's right. We're sick of your training.

46
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,967
We're leaving and you can't stop us.

47
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,808
What would our moms and dads
think of us if they saw us?

48
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,102
It's been seven years.

49
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,479
I wonder if they'd recognize us.

50
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,983
Not because we've grown up
but because of what's been done to us.

51
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,360
All of those years of training.

52
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,613
All those horrible surgeries
and the augmentations.

53
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,159
But everything's changed now.
And not just us.

54
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,327
You really think you can go home?

55
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,831
It doesn't matter. I'm going. I have to.

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,167
It's the only home that I have.

57
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,878
I guess tomorrow is goodbye then.

58
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,758
We won't be able
to see each other anymore, will we?

59
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,847
Of the five escapees from the facility...

60
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,849
...only subject Joseph-122
has been captured.

61
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,852
The search for the other four
is a Priority-Red directive.

62
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,856
Repeat. The search for the other four
is a Priority-Red directive.

63
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,678
Not again. I'm getting off this rock.

64
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,055
And I'm not going home
in a body bag either.

65
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,183
I'm gonna create a diversion. Keep low.

66
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,061
You make a run for the extraction point.

67
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,380
Jesus, they're everywhere.

68
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,009
All the more reason for us to move
as soon as we see the extraction craft.

69
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,513
That sounds like a good idea to me.
I'm gonna go find us a Hog.

70
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,218
Don't you dare slow down.
Heads up.

71
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,513
You okay down there?

72
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,223
They're here.

73
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,262
Notice any resemblance?

74
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,142
The secrecy of the Spartan-ll program
could not be jeopardized.

75
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,895
But the disappearance
of 75 recruits for the program...

76
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,938
...would've created difficult questions.

77
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,108
But if the children never vanished...

78
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,862
...there would be no questions to ask,
would there?

79
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,740
The clone lives a life in your place...

80
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,495
...the life that was originally meant
for you.

81
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,122
Come back to the facility, 23.

82
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,294
It is where you belong. It's home.

83
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,357
Sarge, are you all right?

84
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,487
I will be as soon as we're out of here.

85
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,073
Look, I'll cover you. Go on ahead.

86
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,450
There's no way I'm leaving...
Just go. Now.

87
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,910
Step on it.

88
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,914
Let's go.

89
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,820
Huh?

90
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,661
Faster, faster!

91
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,220
- Daisy!
- Chief!

92
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,939
I'm coming. Stay right there.

93
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,609
There's no time. Go, Ralph.

94
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,444
Get that ship out of here now.

95
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,316
Sometimes I have this drwam.

96
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,195
Always the same dream.

97
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:04,324
I dream I'm strong.
Stronger than anyone.

98
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,995
Like you. Just like you are.

99
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,582
Here. I want you to have this.

100
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,592
But why me?

101
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,429
I don't know, to be honest with you.

102
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,515
I just... Something tells me that I should.

103
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,933
I want you to take it.

104
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,037
My clone. He was... He was sick.

105
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,539
I think I killed him.

106
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,542
Don't do this to yourself, Ralph.

107
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,921
You did what you had to do.

108
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,589
So did I.

109
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,965
Daisy?

110
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,718
Transport to base.

111
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,222
Custody of Daisy-23
and Ralph-303 restored.

112
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,518
Subject's ETA, one hour.
After making contact with their clones...

113
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,897
...the remaining two escapees
used their small arms to commit suicide.

114
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,447
This is Charlie-1.
Sending new rendezvous coordinates.

115
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,908
Prepare to disengage.
