1
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,167
You know this is a trap, do you not?

2
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,570
Coming was foolish.

3
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,923
Your words of dissent
are troubling to us.

4
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,852
We ask so little in return
for the gifts we offer.

5
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,107
Tell me, Arbiter,
is faith too much to ask in exchange?

6
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,200
Harka has chosen the path
of the Great Journey.

7
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,870
Why must you resist?

8
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,665
The Journey will take us farther
than this simple Covenant.

9
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,084
It will deliver us to godhood.

10
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,253
There is only one path for you.

11
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,507
Why must you deny the Journey
that we all must take?

12
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,134
The Journey is a lie!

13
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,391
Is it now?

14
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,268
You're dreaming, my love.
- What?

15
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,234
Forgive me, Han. I am distracted.

16
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,487
Can you not simply serve?

17
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,866
Perhaps, but only when you know
who you are actually serving.

18
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,868
Now I'm not so sure.

19
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,162
You uncertain?

20
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,297
Han, you should leave,
just for a little while.

21
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,384
I'll never leave you. I'm your wife.

22
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,555
And you are the general.
My place is at your side.

23
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,058
You are stubborn to a fault.

24
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,310
I could say the same of you.

25
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,072
Useless.

26
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:47,244
Focus. We are fighting Elite,
the right arm of the Covenant.

27
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,457
The gifts of the Forerunners are nothing if
you don't master the skills to wield them.

28
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,461
Master them you will,
for we are the men of Sanghelios.

29
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,046
Never forget that honor.

30
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,256
Sir! Yes, sir!

31
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,348
Walk with me a moment, Arbiter.

32
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,267
Roe.

33
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,563
I must ask you.

34
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,940
Ask your question.

35
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,236
Tell me, Arbiter, why do you insist
on provoking their patience?

36
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,573
They have given us formidable gifts.

37
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,619
Your status is at risk.

38
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,996
This heresy will strip you of your rank.

39
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,418
There is no rank without honor.

40
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,254
We were strong.

41
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,466
Sanghelios was strong
beforw this Covenant.

42
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,053
And we could be strong once more.

43
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,680
But we have strayed.

44
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,307
We live not for honor but for power.

45
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,558
Listen to yourself.

46
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,398
This talk is not just heresy,
it is treachery.

47
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,817
You are putting your bloodline at risk.

48
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,236
And what of your wife?

49
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,697
What of Han? Arbiter.

50
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:10,869
To protect the future of our clans,
please, please join.

51
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,746
Arbiter.

52
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,959
And now the game begins,
and I must play.

53
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,044
Thel.

54
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,089
I know they will come in force
to challenge me.

55
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,051
And I will not turn away from them.
I will answer their call.

56
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,179
It's not too late.

57
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,133
Cursed Arbiter. Cursed Arbiter.

58
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,469
Cursed Arbiter. Cursed Arbiter.

59
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:16,477
Cursed Arbiter. Cursed Arbiter.
Cursed Arbiter.

60
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,456
So honor is his strength.

61
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,043
Then we shall turn his precious honor
against him.

62
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,754
Draw him out and defeat him publicly.

63
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,633
The badge of Arbiter
will become a mark of shame.

64
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,259
Harka.

65
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,348
Persuade him, yes.
Take away what he finds so precious.

66
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,268
We'll show everyone
how high is the price of dissent.

67
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,474
Come in, Roe.

68
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,812
What's the matter?

69
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,278
Kill her.

70
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:36,241
Then he will have no choice
but to face me in battle.

71
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,549
I'm sorry.

72
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,818
We do this for the Great Journey.

73
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,348
He is a demon.

74
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,857
Han.

75
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,984
Han!

76
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,528
A shame that sword of yours
was too late to save Han.

77
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,532
Such a price for your honor, Arbiter.

78
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,536
You are not worthy
to speak her name.

79
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,539
But I promise
it is the last you will utter.

80
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,461
There will be time for talk
when I rule in your stead.

81
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,590
And declare your shame, Arbiter.
