1
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,278
Sarge, look at the moon.

2
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,740
It's funny.

3
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,785
I never noticed
how beautiful the moons are here.

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,955
You think anybody noticed?

5
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,582
Stay quiet.

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,918
The BioFoam's working,
but you're still bleeding.

7
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,880
There's something
I've always wanted to know.

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,425
Your call sign, "Ghost,"
what does it mean?

9
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,093
Stop talking.

10
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,096
You've gotta hold tight
until the medevac gets here.

11
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,809
You finally have an excuse
to show that you care, and...

12
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,648
Let me ask you something.

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,525
Just one last thing.

14
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,029
It won't hurt, I promise.

15
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,367
- What was I to you?
What do you mean?

16
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,077
You're a soldier.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,330
A soldier with a promising future
ahead of you.

18
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,457
You're a soldier.

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,252
And you're a ghost, aren't you?
- What?

20
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,547
Feelings pass right through you,
don't they?

21
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,176
So cold and unforgiving
in every choice you made in battle.

22
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,012
Pure soldier.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,516
- I think that's what let us trust you...
- Don't talk. Save your strength.

24
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,934
I don't need it.

25
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,602
I need you to be strong.

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,815
Strong enough to do
what you've never done in your life.

27
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,778
Can you be strong enough
to allow yourself to be...?

28
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,363
Can you just be human?

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,960
LIEUTENANT: Damn it, man,
what are you still doing here?

30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,588
- Command has declarwd a rwtrwat.
- We can't pull out.

31
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,050
The civilians may be on their way out,
but there's a core of engineers out there.

32
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,927
- I'm not leaving them behind.
- It ain't up to you.

33
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,430
Cole Protocol's been enacted.
Let's move it.

34
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,101
The shuttles.

35
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,214
LIEUTENANT: If this fighting keeps up,
we're gonna be as good as dead.

36
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,634
We gotta stick it out
and pray they get us some evac.

37
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,010
Let's go.

38
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,974
- Who's left behind?
- What?

39
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,519
Answer me, soldier.
What's the name of the group?

40
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,146
It's the Hades Corps.
They're at Hangar 1030...

41
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,191
...and they're not leaving until
they destroy the prototype...

42
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,859
...of some weapon system.

43
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,361
The demolition squad.

44
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,656
I should've known.

45
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,493
Ghost.

46
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,329
SOLDIER 1:
If the Cole Protocol's been enacted...

47
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,624
...why the hell are we stranded
on the frontline?

48
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,295
We're pinned down here,
and now the sarge is missing.

49
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,214
We're screwed.

50
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,174
SOLDIER 2:
No, we were sunk from the beginning.

51
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,342
What?

52
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,594
SOLDIER 2:
On his last assignment...

53
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,848
...our fearless leader
let his entire platoon go down.

54
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,061
They got wiped out in a single firefight.
Sarge didn't even flinch.

55
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,231
Well, I guess that's why
they call him the Ghost, then, isn't it?

56
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,818
And why the brass always decides
to put him in charge of demolition jobs.

57
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,612
Because he's not even human. Argh!

58
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,120
SOLDIER 1:
Come on, don't die on me. Come on.

59
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,041
I can't believe
these sons of bitches left us behind.

60
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,002
SOLDIER 1:
This is it.

61
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,881
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, my God.

62
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,759
It's the prototype suit.

63
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,304
- But who the hell's driving it?
Ghost to Hades Corps.

64
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,265
Fall back immediately.
Ignore the Covenant.

65
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,434
I'll hold them off.

66
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,770
Nobody's dying here.

67
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,313
You heard him. Let's go.

68
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,941
You idiot.
He's not supposed to be testing that suit.

69
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,360
He's supposed to destroy it.

70
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,379
COMMANDER
Can you hear me, sergeant?

71
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,964
What do you think you're doing?

72
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,717
Your orders are to destroy the suit
and all related data.

73
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,929
- You are disobeying direct orders.
- No, sir. I am following my orders.

74
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,015
Explain yourself.

75
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,641
I have destroyed all the data...

76
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,854
...and I'm using the time left on this suit
to safely evac my people.

77
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,660
I'm not leaving
till every one of my men...

78
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,787
...are safely off...
- That is not the plan.

79
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,832
- I am ordering you to stand down...
- There's no other choice.

80
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,460
The mission cannot be jeopardized.

81
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,049
And I am still responsible
for these Marines.

82
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,636
Wait, sergeant. Ghost, listen to me.

83
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,603
I lost my entire platoon.
Every one of my men.

84
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,064
And that's when it happened.

85
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,025
That's when I truly became a ghost.

86
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,528
Just a shadow...

87
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,530
...surrounded by death.

88
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,870
The suit has a staggered countdown.

89
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,833
In order to trigger final detonation,
the system requires a voice command.

90
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,546
You designed it that way for a reason,
didn't you?

91
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,224
Ghost.

92
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,103
Just get my men off this planet.

93
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,316
This is Ghost. Over and out.

94
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,965
What's the matter, Ghost?
Why can't you move?

95
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,304
I made up my mind that day.

96
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,349
The night I let my platoon die.

97
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,520
I looked up at those moons,
and something died inside me.

98
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,357
A conscience is something
that gets in the way.

99
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:13,153
That's all the soul is: an obstacle.

100
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,739
Something to overcome.

101
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,160
I can't atone for failing to protect them.

102
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,514
SUIT: Countdown contingent.
Voice command required.

103
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,935
Speak the voice command
exactly as displayed.

104
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,649
Let me ask you something.

105
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,068
Just one last thing.

106
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,071
It won't hurt, I promise.

107
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,283
What was I to you?

108
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,201
What do you mean?

109
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,828
You're a soldier.

110
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,206
A soldier with a promising future
ahead of you.

111
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,292
You're a soldier.

112
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,212
And you're a ghost, aren't you?
- What?

113
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,798
Feelings pass right through you,
don't they?

114
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,594
So cold and unforgiving
in every choice you made in battle.

115
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,263
Pure soldier.

116
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,808
- I think that's what let us trust you...
- Don't talk. Save your strength.

117
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,268
I don't need it.

118
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,936
I need you to be strong.

119
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:32,191
Strong enough to do
what you've never done in your life.

120
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,945
Can you be strong enough
to allow yourself to be...?

121
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,031
Can you just be human?

122
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,034
If not for your sake, for all of us.

123
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:47,122
If you would just allow yourself
to feel something...

124
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,710
...maybe you wouldn't be a ghost
any longer.

125
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,142
Voice command authorization.

126
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,978
Be human.

127
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,360
And for one last instant,
I'm human again.

128
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,438
Transmission from orbit around Algolis.

129
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,314
Cole Protocol enforced.

130
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,983
All weapons, prototypes...

131
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,028
...and accompanying
navigational databases eliminated.

132
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,450
The soldier I previously recommended
for military court-martial is...

133
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:09,913
I rescind and redact that portion
of my earlier report.

134
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:16,211
That soldier is officially missing in action,
lost during heavy combat on Algolis.

135
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,631
He demonstrated honorable conduct,
not only as a Marine...

136
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,384
...but also as a human being.

137
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,847
We're heading for rendezvous
with the UNSC Heart of Midlothian.

138
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,807
Over and out.
