1
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,998
Chief, can you hear me?

2
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,626
When I was born, seven years ago...

3
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:49,173
...I already possessed the entire sum
of recorded human knowledge.

4
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,970
It took me almost two hours to process
and understand all that information.

5
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:05,439
But I can't be sure which memories
are mine or even what's true...

6
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,191
...what's real.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,154
I've discovered a great deal more
information since then.

8
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,200
For an Al, I've lived a very long time.

9
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,828
But now, after seven human years...

10
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,207
...I have finally come to understand
your role...

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,250
...your place in the universe.

12
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,420
And how you came to be here.

13
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,343
The eons of human evolution...

14
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:39,098
...invention, aspiration and war.

15
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,517
Always war.

16
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,562
The oldest, most enduring
of human practices.

17
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,444
A hundred thousand years ago...

18
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,074
...a great civilization existed
in this universe.

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,036
Like all great civilizations...

20
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,165
...they faced a sudden and dire
turn of events.

21
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,172
A threat to their primacy from outside.

22
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,968
Something they never expected...

23
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,470
...never prepared for.

24
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:24,768
A deeply alien threat
they called simply the Flood.

25
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:30,315
An unstoppable force,
an unquenchable thirst.

26
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,715
It devoured everything it touched.

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,514
At first their technology, their courage
seemed like it might prevail.

28
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,857
But they waited too long
to see the threat...

29
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,525
...to join the fight.

30
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,531
The Flood had spread too far
and too wide.

31
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,804
It fed on intelligent life,
and in doing so...

32
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,807
...became ever more intelligent itself.

33
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,809
The Flood was unique.

34
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,312
It used their very strength
against them.

35
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,670
They were the Forerunners.

36
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:23,512
The Forerunners were a wise,
highly intelligent, noble people.

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,682
And with a belief in justice, in peace...

38
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,184
...they bravely faced the adversary.

39
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,146
They sought to sterilize it.

40
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,529
I can only guess some of this...

41
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,114
...fill in the gaps.

42
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,784
But it was an impossible fight.

43
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,412
Realizing defeat was inevitable...

44
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,958
...the Forerunners made a decision
to destroy everything.

45
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:37,187
Ironically, they did this
in order to preserve life...

46
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,858
...to create a future for you,
yet unborn...

47
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:45,029
...knowing they themselves
would not survive.

48
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,880
In a desperate attempt to ensure that
they would be the last victims...

49
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,842
...they built a secret weapon
of terrifying power.

50
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,274
It was called Halo...

51
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,570
...an array of weapons
scattered throughout the galaxy.

52
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:31,283
Its effect would spread throughout
known space, destroying the Flood...

53
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,037
...and every thinking creature
in the galaxy.

54
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,726
You see, the Flood fed
on sentient species to survive.

55
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:03,399
The device would destroy the infection
and its food supply.

56
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,904
A thousand other plans
were tried, and failed.

57
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,201
This was the last resort. Halo.

58
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,563
And finally, it was over in an instant.

59
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:51,030
Every intelligent life form
left in the galaxy was obliterated.

60
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,120
But from the ashes
of apparent defeat...

61
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,955
...a victory.

62
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,584
The Forerunners had cataloged,
stored and protected...

63
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,962
...population samples
from the Halo event.

64
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,592
DNA, embryos, even living specimens.

65
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,349
In order to repopulate,
restore the galaxy.

66
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,985
Once the galaxy was cleansed of Flood,
the threat sterilized...

67
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,197
...they repopulated worlds...

68
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,992
...rebuilt that which
they had torn down...

69
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,620
...and reseeded life.

70
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,312
But the Forerunners themselves
were gone forever.

71
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:12,945
This destruction, this conflagration
was their gift to you...

72
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,698
...and their sacrifice.

73
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,036
They left you to reclaim your world...

74
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,373
...to rebuild it with your own hands...

75
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,878
...by sacrificing themselves...

76
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,257
...eternally.

77
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:38,178
It seemed that life had finally
found its peace.
