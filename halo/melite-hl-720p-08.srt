1
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,263
The Covenant has captured
a high-priority package.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,267
Spartans, it's yourjob
to infiltrate enemy space and retrieve it.

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,519
Mission window: 10 minutes.

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,439
The target is equipped
with a location beacon...

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:27,693
...but you'll have to get close to read it.
It's a weak signal with a short radius.

6
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,030
A stellar magnetic field
is preventing the Covenant fleet...

7
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,781
...from making a Slipspace jump.

8
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,034
You'll be flying in
with EVA booster frames.

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,328
When you reach the Covenant fleet,
find the signal, find the ship...

10
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,664
...find a way in and grab that target.

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,543
The Covenant doesn't appear to realize
the full value of what they've acquired.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,046
And that's the way we wanna keep it.

13
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,674
Complete the extraction
before they figure out what they've got.

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,635
All right, Spartans, you have your orders.
Good luck.

15
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,387
Yes, sir.

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,516
Captain.
What is it, Master Chief?

17
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,310
What happens if we run out of time?

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,938
Our only choice will be
to annihilate the Covenant fleet...

19
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,441
...the package and your entire team.

20
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,735
Is that clear enough?

21
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,236
I understand.

22
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,243
Spartan team,
the moment we break stealth...

23
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,579
...commence operation.

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:26,418
Five, four, three, two, one.

25
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,713
Disable cloak. Booster frame.

26
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,173
Launch.

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,150
Incoming. Optimize mobility.

28
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,366
Plasma rounds.

29
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,132
Scanning device is activated.

30
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,889
I've got a reading.

31
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,933
Are you sure?
No question.

32
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,394
Back me up, I'm going in.

33
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,235
Their shields are down.

34
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,571
The signal's coming from that cruiser.

35
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,531
Hang on, Solomon, wait for the Chief.

36
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,868
No time. I'll take my chances.

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,081
All right, if we're gonna do this,
let's make it fast.

38
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,843
Positive rwad
from the first scan. Something's off.

39
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,597
Hurry, Solomon.

40
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,769
Gotcha.

41
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,606
No.

42
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,025
- Kelly, it's a trap.
No.

43
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,370
They took the bait.
Three have perished.

44
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,373
The rest are only a matter of time.

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,209
We must always show
our superior strength.

46
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,380
Anything less
and they will exploit our weakness.

47
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,384
Weakness. You have faced
these lowly creatures in battle...

48
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,552
...while your battalion perished.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,222
That tells me only one thing.

50
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,392
You have not the heart
to die with honor.

51
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,894
Commander, two survivors detected.

52
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,400
Solomon.
Kelly, look.

53
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,652
I'm getting multiple readings.

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,321
They're decoys.
They know what we came for.

55
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,448
How do we find the real signal?

56
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,033
They've already told us.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,703
What we want is in the heart
of this fleet.

58
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,788
The flagship.

59
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,834
Syrup formation, 2 o'clock.

60
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,670
Ignore them. Stay on target.

61
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,558
Four enemies approaching.

62
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,060
They know.

63
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,188
Will you run away once more?

64
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,066
They will be here. I shall face them.

65
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,610
You overestimate them.

66
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,071
They cannot touch this ship.

67
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,117
I pray that you are right.

68
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,582
Tight formation, now.

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,001
Concentrate Gauss cannons
on a single point.

70
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,294
Roger.
Roger.

71
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,296
Shields at maximum charge.

72
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,300
They're still with us.

73
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,513
- I'm hit.
I'll hold them back.

74
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,770
I'm losing it.

75
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,315
Arthur!

76
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,785
You've gotta eject. I got your six.

77
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,291
You securw?
Give me the turrwt.

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,001
Now I got your six.

79
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,128
Let's get on with it.

80
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,677
Gauss cannon charge, 85 percent.

81
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,016
They're advancing position.

82
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,018
Ninety-one percent.

83
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,524
There it is.

84
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,780
Launch all missiles.

85
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,533
Gauss cannon, fire.

86
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,164
This thing's toast.

87
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,542
Then let them have it.

88
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,979
Looks like this is the right ship.

89
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,024
We got three minutes.
Let's sprint this.

90
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,567
Don't fall behind.

91
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,402
Copy that.
Copy that.

92
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,867
Go.

93
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,652
Three units passing Sector 25.

94
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,530
Stop them. Seal all hatches.

95
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,534
Frwd.
I got it.

96
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,401
The enemy is advancing.
- No.

97
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,819
Where is the major?

98
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,669
Go. I got this.

99
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:30,092
All right, the great journey ends here.

100
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,219
Fred.
Focus on the mission.

101
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,804
We get the target.

102
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,806
Commander, they're getting closer.

103
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,850
Getting closer, are they?

104
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,810
Not for long.

105
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,110
Chief.

106
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,826
Break off the entire block.

107
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,370
But, commander, our brothers have...

108
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,705
Silence.

109
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,208
Let them die with honor.

110
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,974
Chief.

111
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,227
Go get her.

112
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,230
Kelly.

113
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
Kelly.

114
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,076
Dr. Halsey.

115
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,039
John.

116
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,292
- It's you?
- Yes. I'm here to take you back.

117
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,381
- Sleep well, doctor?
No thanks to their driving, yes.

118
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,134
You seem to be in one piece.

119
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,720
Maybe your luck has rubbed off on me.

120
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,596
We make our own luck...

121
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,598
...but I'll always be there
when you need me.

122
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,643
Don't make a girl a promise
if you know you can't keep it.

123
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,023
- Still, thank you.
- Surw.

124
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,400
- Dr. Halsey...
It's not a proper rescue...

125
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,444
...until you get us out of here, right?

126
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,489
Agreed. We need to move fast.

127
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,865
John, wait.

128
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,868
We'rw out of time.
What? No.

129
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,953
We're clear
of the magnetic interference.

130
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,664
Stand by for Slipspace jump.

131
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,250
They're trapped in Delta section.

132
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,169
Separate the moment we jump.

133
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,837
But what of the major
and his group?

134
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,631
No matter.

135
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,758
He is already shamed.

136
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:03,222
His only path now is death or arbiter.

137
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,393
I had him.

138
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,480
Commander, you fool.

139
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,401
A thousand hells await you!

140
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,199
They're scuttling the ship.

141
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,076
And us with it.

142
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,704
But we make our own luck,
remember?

143
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,669
What are you suggesting?

144
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,171
What else? We improvise.

145
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,351
Doctor, we've got company.

146
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,104
Can't you do anything?

147
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,941
Can't this bucket go any faster?

148
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,989
What's happening?

149
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,283
Cutting it a little close, aren't we?

150
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,951
Fred.

151
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,786
Doctor, are you all right?

152
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,288
Yes, I'm fine.

153
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,583
These Covenant rigs fly like rocks.
It took us a bit to get rolling.

154
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,335
Incoming.

155
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,298
What?
Welcome back, Spartans.

156
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,147
You really are lucky. You know that.

157
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,316
Not lucky enough.

158
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,902
We lost two Spartans today.

159
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,154
Solomon and Arthur.

160
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:46,575
And that Elite we encountered,
he was strong.

161
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,495
I have to be stronger.

162
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,373
We all have to be stronger.

163
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,835
Something tells me
this is just the beginning.
