1
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,499
Hey, easy there, Berger.
What do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,418
- What?
- They're Helljumpers.

3
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,421
Every one of those guys
arw ODSTs from the 105th.

4
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,632
They're in a whole different league.
Let's go.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,509
Unh. Aw, come on.

6
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,677
I wanna hear what they're saying.

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,304
No.

8
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,556
I don't get it.

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,808
How did everybody conveniently forget...

10
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,186
...that I'm the best shot
this side of Eridanus?

11
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,481
Getting assigned to backup
is a bunch of B.S.

12
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,776
Contingency. It's an important mission.

13
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,570
If the first sniper misses,
they take the shot.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,489
I don't miss. I never miss.

15
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,699
This sucks and you know it.

16
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,576
I'm nobody's babysitter.

17
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,788
Especially not some
farm-boy moose hunter.

18
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,040
I hate to be the one
to break the bad news...

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,460
...but you weren't selected to be
the primary shooter on this mission.

20
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,464
So it seems
they want your farm boy to do it.

21
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,759
I guess that makes you the backup.
Sorry, O'Brian.

22
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,761
I'm the backup?

23
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,766
- And the shooter is a Spartan.
What?

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,853
And that means
this mission just got escalated.

25
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,078
This is Spartan Cal-141...

26
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,789
...who'll be the ranking officer
on this mission.

27
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,708
I realize that is highly unusual...

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,794
...and you have strong feelings
about Spartans.

29
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,590
You will keep those feelings
out of the mission and follow the plan.

30
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,553
Satellite rwcon shows radar
and magnetic signatures...

31
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,888
...on high end in the Arc star cluster.

32
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,599
These signatures indicate
a complex of buildings.

33
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,268
It's a logistical base.

34
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,022
The Prophet you are targeting
is in control of this entire sector.

35
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,775
Our mission is simple.
We want this Prophet dead.

36
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,280
We take out the Prophet, we will
stop the Covenant chain of supply.

37
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,949
If we achieve the goal of this mission...

38
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,286
...we will able to buy ourselves months
of tactical advantage.

39
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,291
And we will do all of this
with minimal risk to the UNSC.

40
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,295
Hmm.
Other than to this group, of course.

41
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:56,508
Cortez, fill them in on the details.

42
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:01,680
Right. You'll be flying into the atmosphere
with a Leonid-class meteor shower.

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,808
Meteor showers
are a regular occurrence on this planet...

44
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,978
...so that means entry and landing
should go unnoticed.

45
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,690
Calculations show reaching the target
will take a 14-hour fast march...

46
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,233
...from your entry point.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,902
Once you reach the target...

48
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,780
...take out the Prophet
as soon as he steps off that ship.

49
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,993
Then you are to gather all data
relating to the unidentified alien ruins.

50
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,621
What do you mean,
they're not identified?

51
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,664
The architecture is
not Covenant-designed...

52
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,833
...and it sure as hell
wasn't built by humans.

53
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,002
They predate both sides.

54
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,630
This site is of the utmost importance.

55
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,007
We photograph everything.

56
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,635
That will be all, master sergeant.
Rejoin your men.

57
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,429
You will be dropping
in precisely five minutes.

58
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,641
With this mission,
there is no room for delay or error.

59
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,144
Good luck, and Godspeed.

60
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,991
Dutch, come in.

61
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,535
I'm all right. Where's O'Brian?

62
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,958
Over therw.

63
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,183
His oxygen tank.

64
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,310
Dutch, get the gear.

65
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,187
We gotta get him out of there.

66
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,024
Are you guys nuts? Why are you
throwing me around like that?

67
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,579
We lost Checkman in the atmosphere.

68
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,333
- What?
- And we almost lost you too.

69
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,182
Their logistics and
refueling base is here. We're here.

70
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,644
The Prophet will be coming in
at exactly 0800.

71
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:22,399
Hmm. Everything depends on us
getting a clear shot from this location...

72
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,944
...and we've got to hit him
as soon as he's exiting that ship.

73
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,738
It's two miles from the target...

74
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,574
...and should give us the elevation
for the shot.

75
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,534
It's pretty far...

76
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,996
...but it will give us enough cover
to make our extraction.

77
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,917
Assuming that the Spartan
can make the shot, that is.

78
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,798
And if we don't
make it to the target in time?

79
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,758
There won't be any second chances.

80
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,720
It's a long-ass march.
Then we better get marching.

81
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,122
Wanna take the lens cap off?

82
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,332
Knock it off, O'Brian.

83
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,337
I'm not crippled. Put me down.

84
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,556
You bitch any louder...

85
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,975
...and this place will be crawling
with Covenant.

86
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,936
Shut your mouth! He just got lucky.

87
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,372
That's twice.

88
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,333
Twice he had to save your dumb ass
already.

89
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,377
You could at least say "thank you. "

90
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,140
Man, those are some stairs.

91
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,024
The shuttle will be
touching down in two minutes.

92
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,575
After all this, he better
be everything they said he was.

93
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,642
Take him out!

94
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,800
Take the shot. O'Brian, now!

95
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,178
You're the only one who can do it.

96
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,728
It's the data on the ruins.

97
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,732
Tell them...

98
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,152
...to get it to Halsey.

99
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,821
She'll know.

100
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
No, you give it to her.

101
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:58,207
We both know
that's not gonna be possible.

102
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,542
Heard about what you guys did
down there.

103
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,751
Took out a Prophet...

104
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,921
...and stopped the Covenant's
supply chain dead for the sector.

105
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,090
They say a Spartan died there.

106
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,884
Went down faster than a new bood
on his first day.

107
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,430
I thought those guys
were supposed to be unbeatable.

108
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,518
Huh. I guess he didn't have what it takes
to hang with the Helljumpers, huh?

109
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,061
Shut up.

110
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,108
What's your problem?
What is the matter with you?

111
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,152
What'd I say?
