1
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,275
What? He slipped and fell?

2
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,778
- 1337, wasn't it?
- You think he'll be okay?

3
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,072
This kind of thing
happens to him all the time.

4
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:37,161
Well, 1337 is still a Spartan.
He's been trained with the best of them.

5
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,079
There's no need for concern.

6
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,290
If you say so, Master Chief.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,501
It wouldn't be the first time
he fell off a Pelican.

8
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,464
- But still, I am a little worried.
MASTER CHIEF: Yeah.

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,717
Oh, no.

10
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,097
Hey! Wait for me! Come back!

11
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,933
Don't leave me behind!

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,479
I'm gonna have to rendezvous with them
somewhere.

13
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,897
Huh?

14
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,983
I wonder if these natives are dangerous?

15
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,320
Hey, look at that.
It's the junky old robot that fell.

16
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,697
Ha-ha-ha. I am not some junky robot.

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,492
Even if you don't wanna know,
I'll tell you who I am.

18
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,536
I am one of the strongest warriors
in space.

19
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,540
I am Spartan-1337.

20
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,210
- I wouldn't stand there if I were you.
- It's not safe.

21
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,129
How dare they ignore
my awesome heroism.

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,841
Fear not. I am the strongest warrior
in the... Oh, no.

23
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,891
I'm fine. That was just a few dents.

24
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,610
He doesn't really get along with strangers
all that much.

25
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:59,451
So where is the accursed group
of Spartans?

26
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,872
ALIEN 2 On Cronkee,
the fourth planet of the Unicon system.

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,959
Excellent.
This is the perfect opportunity...

28
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,714
...to show those Spartans a thing or two
about Covenant power.

29
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:16,260
- Bring out Pluton.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,057
Yes. It is the finest bio-warrior
ever created.

31
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,686
Now go to the planet Cronkee
and demonstrate our might.

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,440
But Pluton's weapons
are still in the experimental stage.

33
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,234
They'll be enough
to vanquish the humans.

34
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,862
Don't you think a real battle
will be the best way...

35
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,905
...to conduct our little test?

36
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,449
If that is your wish.

37
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,578
I will get you at long last, Master Chief.
Now go, Pluton!

38
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,581
Guh.
- Not "guh. " Go destroy them!

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,751
No, not over here.

40
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,086
- He's over that way. He's over there!
- Huh?

41
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,588
Don't "huh" me. Go that way.

42
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,094
I need a vacation.

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,148
Chief, respond please.
Can you hear me? Chief? Over.

44
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,817
There's some strange interference.

45
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,945
- Hello? Can you hear me?
We can hear you.

46
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,907
Not you. And I thought I told you
to stop following me.

47
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,035
Robot, look.
- I told you I'm not a robot.

48
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,468
What's that?

49
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,970
Sure is a lot ofjunk
falling from the sky today.

50
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,021
Covenant? It's dangerous.
Get out of herw!

51
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,315
- As far as you can.
Okay.

52
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,772
Chief, this... Stop it. Stop it.

53
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,467
Are you guys all right?

54
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,386
- Hey, look. It's big brother.
And big sister.

55
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,221
Any of you know
what that thing is?

56
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,724
It looks like he almost blew up
the mountain range.

57
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,728
He fell from the sky. All of a sudden, he
and this giant monkey started going nuts.

58
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,439
Don't worry.
Your big brother is gonna take care of it.

59
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,567
Yeah. Well, he might be a little tougher
than you think.

60
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,570
We don't have much choice.
We'll just have to try our best.

61
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,238
Yeah, you might lose.

62
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,908
Why would you say that?
Give me some credit, will you?

63
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,078
It must have been scary.
Are you sure you're okay?

64
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,829
I'm kind of hungry.

65
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,125
All right, let's do this.

66
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,298
I'm not gonna lose. No way can I lose.

67
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:46,595
I am Spartan-1337.

68
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,144
No one else will say it, so I will.

69
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,273
The fact that I never give up
is one of my good points!

70
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,068
Hey, look. The rain stopped.

71
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,697
The robot's back.

72
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,448
What's that?

73
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,618
Apparently they used to travel
between the stars with that.

74
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,830
An old UNSC frigate.
Must've crash-landed.

75
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,416
I hear that we were all born inside there.

76
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,085
Mama raised us all by herself.

77
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,545
Mama?

78
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,507
You kids should stay behind.
This is my fight.

79
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,844
Don't worry about it. We may
not look it, but we're pretty tough.

80
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,887
Though, we're no match for Mama.

81
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,097
Mama, huh?

82
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,558
When we werw still little
she fought off a bunch...

83
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,393
...of bird-headed pirates by herself.

84
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,812
That sounds like one heck of a mama.

85
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,857
But you know what?

86
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,027
I'm one heck of a mama myself.

87
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,683
I did it.

88
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,852
I did it!

89
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,232
Oh, no. We'll be done for
if he reaches full strength.

90
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,235
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah, and that's gonna be the hard part.

91
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,528
Less talk, more action.

92
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,083
Ah!

93
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,103
This isn't good. He won't budge.

94
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,313
We're totally screwed.

95
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,773
What else can we do?

96
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,233
We're doomed.

97
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,402
Well, don't jinx us!

98
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,736
I'm just kidding.

99
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,072
We gotta do something.

100
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,409
Hey, what the heck is that?

101
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,161
Oh, as if he'd ever fall for that.

102
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,622
He did fall for it.

103
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,751
He did? He did.
Now let's get out of here.

104
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,434
Whoa. What's happening?

105
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,608
No way.

106
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,152
Ah!

107
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,947
Is that a Slipspace rupture?

108
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,707
Ah!

109
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,135
That was Mama.

110
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,221
I told you, no one was as tough as Mama.

111
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,309
Master Chief,
radio contact has been reestablished.

112
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,146
Good. I'll try to contact 1337.

113
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,732
There's another Al living on this planet.

114
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,109
What?
- I've lost contact with it.

115
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,864
But I'm pretty sure I felt it just tinkering
with the Slipspace drive.

116
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,742
She's another Al it seems. Just like I am.

117
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,035
Why here?

118
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,205
- You want me to collect her?
- No. Let's not do that.

119
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,584
It's a very old Al construct.
You might say something of an antique.

120
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,003
- She seems...
- Seems what?

121
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:53,842
Happy. If I'm understanding correctly,
she seems to be happy here. Hm.

122
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,262
Hm.

123
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,139
We're home.

124
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,434
Were you playing as cavemen
again? You really do like that game.

125
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,937
Mama, you're not gonna believe
what happened today.

126
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,607
All right, all right.
You can tell me all about that later.

127
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,776
Mama, just what did you do back there?

128
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,070
That's not important right now.

129
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,738
By the way, dinner is ready.

130
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,573
I'm hungry.
I thought so.

131
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,243
- Now go wash your hands.
Okay.

132
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,370
And clean behind your ears.

133
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,125
Mama.

134
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,795
Can you hear me, 1337? Come in, 1337.

135
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,173
This is 1337. I hear you clearly, sir.

136
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,385
Head to the rendezvous point immediately.
Rendezvous ASAP, over.

137
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:42,558
Huh? Roger that, sir,
but I may run a little late!

138
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,741
Guh.
