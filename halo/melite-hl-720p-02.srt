1
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,015
Peace settled on the galaxy.

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,976
But it would be a fleeting peace.

3
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,564
For the great sacrifice was in vain.

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,610
The end of one war
did not signal an end to all wars.

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,741
It is a great irony
that the nature of war...

6
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:38,037
...always reveals the true nature
of those who fight.

7
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,625
And from their earliest days,
humanity began to fight...

8
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,670
...war after war.

9
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,051
It swarmed over the earth
and there was no ending in sight.

10
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,805
In the midst of the desire
to shed blood...

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:01,352
...you accidentally stumbled upon
the seeds of your salvation.

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,068
A great hope.

13
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,822
But you found something else, as well.

14
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,286
The seeds of your destruction.

15
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,006
There were many sacrifices.

16
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,969
Humankind was mired
in horrific conflict...

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,097
...meaningless bloodshed...

18
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:42,226
...leaving the great Earth
eternally scarred.

19
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,358
But finally...

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:54,279
...you looked up from the blood
and from the dirt and from the dying...

21
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,699
...to the stars.

22
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:04,540
You had not given up on the idea
of reaching out, yearning...

23
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,626
...seeking a new horizon...

24
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:14,299
...and finding a new space
to grow and prosper.

25
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:20,264
For the first time, all of humankind
was united in a shared vision...

26
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,933
...a common goal.

27
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:29,064
You realized that this once great planet
was now too small for you.

28
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,650
There were too many souls...

29
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,278
...and so little a world.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,615
So you sought other worlds.

31
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,954
Worlds where you could escape
your addiction to destruction.

32
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,157
But the worlds you found
were never enough.

33
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,870
Never enough to satisfy
the age-old instincts.

34
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:30,000
Speed and distance did nothing
to separate you from your nature.

35
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,466
Old resentments,
ancient squabbles reemerged.

36
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,803
History began its terrible repetition...

37
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,307
...and once again, man fought man.

38
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,233
Like a virus,
war was always lurking inside you.

39
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,069
No matter how hard you tried to
suppress it...

40
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,406
...it just fought harder to get out.

41
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,326
It always got out.

42
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:20,801
Humankind had always looked to
the stars, to the heavens for answers.

43
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,305
Sometimes you didn't like
what you found there.

44
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,684
And while the galaxy revealed
few answers...

45
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:33,272
...it was more than willing to
confront you with new questions.

46
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:41,905
But there has always been one
truly unifying force in human history...

47
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,826
...one call that would always
unite you:

48
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,621
The emergence of a common enemy.

49
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,158
That enemy was the Covenant.

50
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,746
When this new foe emerged
and declared war against humanity...

51
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,875
...you finally united,
under a single banner.

52
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,879
And the weapons
you so carefully constructed...

53
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:44,259
...to control your own baser instincts
were now aimed not at yourselves...

54
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,679
...but against a deadly opponent...

55
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,765
...in pursuit of a shared goal:

56
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,559
The very survival of your species.

57
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,570
Then, as if awakened
by the arrival of the Covenant...

58
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:50,534
...a darker, far more ancient threat
emerged from its slumber.

59
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,985
Darkness born in eons past...

60
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,532
...became a threat to all life
once again.

61
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,493
And humankind and the Covenant...

62
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,913
...who had drowned for so long
in each other's blood...

63
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,707
...were united,
if only for the briefest moment...

64
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,294
...against a terrible enemy
they both shared.

65
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,937
Righteous souls continued to fight...

66
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,732
...believing that they could defeat
the darkness.

67
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,613
And as they fought together,
they stumbled together into peace.

68
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,429
This galaxy is vast.

69
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,184
Its wonders and beauty
are almost unfathomable.

70
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,689
But the galaxy also hides
dark secrets...

71
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,903
...some of which have lain dormant
since the beginning of time itself.

72
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,770
There is a danger in secrets...

73
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,649
...both in seeking and in knowing.

74
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,319
Some things are meant to be
hidden from view.

75
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:18,158
You see,
some mysteries defy understanding.

76
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:24,665
And sometimes even the things
we think we know are untrue.

77
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,879
Some secrwts should rwmain
untouched.

78
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,722
Secrets can tempt
your primal instinct...

79
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,058
...and lead you again into war.

80
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,061
The Halos were one such secret.

81
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,477
Chief, can you hear me?

82
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,565
I wonder why humans
must continue to fight.

83
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:58,092
I wonder if warriors
will ever disappear from this world.

84
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,057
Never.

85
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,396
There will always be warriors...

86
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,816
...and there will always be war.
